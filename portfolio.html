        <p> Having closely worked with Pricing Analytics, I discovered how Pricing data is used in the industry. Besides
            Agile projects, my work involved discussing business requirements of projects, analyzing various issues and
            designing solutions.<br><br>
            While working on an analytical project, I gathered a huge amount of data of 6 Lines of Business for the
            insurance client which was rate impacting. This data was then segregated on various parameters and scaled
            based on the extent of impact. The segregation was used for impact and risk analysis, to improve services
            and stay on top of the business. <br><br>
            I automated various processes for the team for which I was appreciated by onshore and offshore management.
            The process initiated by identifying a problem area, collecting information involved in the processes,
            designing possible solutions and weighing their impacts.

        <h3><u>Academic Research and Project</u></h3>
        <p>While pursuing Bachelor of Technology from SNDT Women's University (2012-2016), I worked on a research
            project as part of my curriculum.<br><br>
            <b>Title: Medical Emergency System for Road Accidents using Airbot (Quadcopter)</b><br><br>
            <b>Summary:</b>
            The project focuses on developing a system that caters to the need of medical emergencies that arise during
            road accidents. This was motivated by an initial analysis with the help of the RTO of the number of accident
            victims suffering due to not receiving timely medical help. In this project, an Airbot is used to deliver
            the required first aid. Various means of communication are used to achieve this goal such as the use of GPS,
            along with the use of an integrated camera to help view the accident site.<br><br>
            <b>Publication:</b>
            A technical paper on “Design and control of electronics based medical emergency system using a Quadcopter”
            was published in <a href="https://ijritcc.org/index.php/ijritcc/article/view/2180/2180"
                target="_blank">‘International Journal on Recent and innovation trends in computing and communication
